# Bookstore
A full-stack online bookstore built for my CS351 (Database Management Systems) course that I have been expanding as a personal project.

Technologies I Used: Node.js (Express and other tools), MySql, Pug, Bootstrap 3, HTML5

To my knowledge, the website is up-to-date here: https://cs351bookstore-ckqtghjksz.now.sh/
(User accounts can be registered, but manager accounts can only be made through the database.)

The store supports the following operations:
Customer: Registering, logging in/sessions, browsing books (searching by attributes), purchasing books, checking orders
Manager: Logging in/sessions, searching for books, modifying book attributes, deleting books, inserting books, placing store orders, checking low stock books, checking store orders

Feel free to email me at tryan1996@gmail.com for any questions or concerns about this project.
